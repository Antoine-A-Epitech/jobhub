## üëã About us :

<p>Job<span style="background-color: orange; color: black">Hub</span> is a platform on which you can <b><u>look</u></b>, <b><u>create</u></b> and <b><u>apply</u></b> for job offers.</p>

# Get Started :
## Installation :
First of all, you will need to clone the repo then :
```bash
cd jobhub
```

#### To do in `/client` :
In the client folder, you will need to first of all install the dependencies by doing :
```bash
npm i
```
And then compile the sass to css by doing :
```bash
cd sass
sass main.sass main.css
```

#### To do in `/server` :
Just like the client folder, you will need to navigate in the folder than type :

```bash
npm i  
```
Then, you will have to create the `.env` file. Following the template and for more information [click here](#environment-variables).
Then you will need to create the tables by doing :
```bash
node initiateDb.js
```
## üèÉ Run it :
So to run it, it's not very practical I know, but after all we're simulating reality. So you will need to terminal windows.
1. In the first window, navigate in the `/server` folder and start the server by doing :
```bash
node index.js
```
2. In the second window, navigate in the `/client` folder and start the client app by doing :
```bash
npm start
```
It will ask you to go on post `3001` just press `y`.
3. It will take you automatically to the page and there you go, you can **create** a user, **login** and **enjoy** !

## üìú Documentation :

#### üß¨ Project Structure :
`/client` : The folder in which everything the client will have access to. (The react)
- `/client/public`: All the public ressources that will be available for the client.
  - `/client/public/images` : The images that will be used in the website.


- `/client/src`: This is the main folder of the website. All the source code will be stored in there. Everything that is crucial to the functioning of our website.
  - `/client/src/components`: All the react components will be stored in here in folders with the names of the components. It was done this way for the reusability of the components which is the mother concept of **React**.
  - `/client/src/helpers`: Where some JS functions used in the project are defined and some routing helpers.
  - `/client/src/pages`: In this folder we have the different pages. Each page (file) inside the folder is structured with some basic react.
   **Eg:**
    ```js
    import React from 'react';
    import HomeDisplay from '../components/HomeDisplay'; // The component

    export default function Home() {
      return (
        <HomeDisplay />
      );
    }
    ```
  - `/client/src/sass`: In here we have some sass code that we used to override some of the `react-bootstrap` styles. The sass will be compiled to **css** and imported to the `index.js`.

`/server`: Where all the express is located.
- `/server/helpers` : In here we have the helpers function that will be imported throughout the project.

- `/server/routes` : The different routes that our server will respond to.
